This is our Assignment I, we provided Data, Code and a Summary. 

Most important are two Files: 

- 20230418_Assignment_I.PDF: This provides all discussion and interpretation parts, as well as the main(!) figures and tables. As we haven't had the time to introduce markdown in our group, there is neither every test nor any code included. 

- 20230418_Assignment_I.R: This is our extensive commented R code, which was tried to be written in clean code s.t. you could replicate everything, which leaves doubt. Just drop the whole extracted file in one folder, and set the wd to this folder (First part of the code). 

Many Thanks.
