# University_Contributions
This repository contains a collection of academic and research contributions made during my bachelor's and master's degree programs. It exists for helping future/current students as well as giving some orientation. However, keep in mind the majority of my coding experience comes from working on company projects, which, due to confidentiality reasons, cannot be shared. Additionally, I've evolved as a researcher.
