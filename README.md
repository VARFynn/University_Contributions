# University_Contributions
This repository contains a collection of academic and research contributions made during my bachelor's and master's degree programs. It exists for two reasons: (1) Helping future/current students and give some orientation and (2) showcasing some of my coding skills. However, the majority of my coding skills were developed during project work, which contains confidential data and can, thus, not be shared. 

In case of any questions, do no hesitate to reach out: VARFynn@gmail.com
