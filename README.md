# University_Contributions
This repository contains a collection of academic and research contributions made during my bachelor's and master's degree programs. It exists for two reasons: (1) Helping future/current students as well as giving some orientation and (2) showcasing some of my coding skills. However, the plethora of my coding experience was on company proejcts, which can due to confidentially not be shared.
